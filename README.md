# quizdroid

The second part of a 5 part assignment. This app allows the user to take a quiz from three different topics: Marvel Superheroes, physics, and math. It will keep track of how many they have gotten correct and wrong as well as show what the correct answer was. When a quiz is finished, you can return to the main menu. 

In this updated version instead of the topics and questions being hard coded, they are read from a JSON file
